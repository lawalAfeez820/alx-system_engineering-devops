Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 1, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 1, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors for approximately 30% of users.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the web stack outage was identified as a database connection bottleneck that caused performance degradation and ultimately led to service instability.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts indicating increased response times and error rates.
Actions taken:
The operations team initiated an initial investigation and began monitoring various system components.
Assumptions on the root cause were centered around potential network issues or high server load impacting the database.
Misleading investigation/debugging paths:
Due to the initial assumption of network issues, network configurations and connections were inspected, but no abnormalities were found.
Similarly, server load analysis did not reveal any excessive utilization that could explain the performance degradation.
The incident was escalated to the database administration team for further investigation and resolution.
12:00 PM: After analyzing database logs and performance metrics, the database team identified a bottleneck in the connection pool due to misconfigured parameters, leading to a limited number of available connections.

Resolution:

The database team reconfigured the connection pool settings to allow for a higher number of concurrent connections.

A rolling restart of the web servers was performed to apply the new configuration and ensure proper connection establishment.

The web application's performance was fully restored by 2:00 PM, and users experienced normal response times and stability.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was determined to be a database connection bottleneck caused by misconfigured connection pool parameters. This bottleneck limited the number of available connections, leading to degraded performance and intermittent errors.

To address the issue, the database team reconfigured the connection pool settings to allow for a higher number of concurrent connections. This adjustment expanded the capacity of the pool, alleviating the bottleneck and improving overall performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

Conduct a thorough review of all connection pool configurations across the system to ensure they align with expected usage patterns and demand.

Implement regular monitoring of connection pool usage and performance to proactively identify any potential bottlenecks or misconfigurations.

Develop and enforce standard operating procedures for configuration changes to mitigate the risk of misconfigurations impacting critical system components

Tasks to address the issue:

Review and adjust connection pool parameters for all database instances to accommodate expected usage and scale.

Implement automated monitoring and alerting specifically for database connection pool usage and performance.

Conduct a knowledge-sharing session with the operations and database teams to enhance understanding of connection pool configuration and best practices.

By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to prevent future occurrences of database connection bottlenecks and ensure the continued stability and performance of our web application.

Overall, the incident highlighted the importance of regular monitoring, thorough investigation, and collaborative resolution to promptly identify and mitigate issues, safeguarding the reliability and user experience of our web stack
